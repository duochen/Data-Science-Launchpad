    "# Project: Medical Cost Predication\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "### Goal: \n",
    "Predict an individual’s medical insurance cost (charges) using their demographic features.\n",
    "### Real-World Application: \n",
    "Insurance companies can estimate premiums for customers based on health factors and risk attributes,\n",
    "while individuals can learn how personal factors (e.g., smoking, BMI, age) affect insurance costs.\n",
    "### Method: \n",
    "Since the objective is to determine the relationship between a number of factors(features) and cost(target), it would be a Supervised Learning problem. We would apply Multiple Linear Regression.\n",
    "### Dataset:\n",
    "The dataset1 contains:\n",
    "- age: Age of primary beneficiary.\n",
    "- sex: Gender of the beneficiary (male/female).\n",
    "- bmi: Body mass index.\n",
    "- children: Number of children/dependents covered by insurance.\n",
    "- smoker: Smoking behavior (yes/no).\n",
    "- region: The beneficiary’s residential area in the US (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest).\n",
    "- charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance."
